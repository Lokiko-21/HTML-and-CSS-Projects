# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
### Here you will find some projects and challenges that I did at The Tech Academy

* One-Page Website
* Space Station Website
* Bootstrap 4 Project

### One-Page Website
This is one of the first websites I made and it features a made-up company "Desque". While
making this project I mainly focused on trying out different features that HTML has such as
embedding a YouTube video, adding pictures, and making a form. I later went on to add some
JavaScript code to add some functionality when clicking on the pictures.


### Space Station Website
In this project, I created a website for a Space Station resort in which a user can make
a reservation for a space launch to different planets. The styling was more of a priority in
this project since I wanted to make sure it was more pleasing for a user to look at. I added
small things such as animations, a simple and soft color palette, and a very straightforward
structure to the website.

### Bootstrap 4 Project
In this project, I used Bootstrap 4 as a way to expand my knowledge using frameworks in
front-end development. The website is for a movie theater "Academy Cinemas" to which a user
can register and receive monthly notifications on movie deals. I used Bootstrap to make all
of the styling in this website.
